# ChurchMannySystem
The reason for this chosen domain is that in some churches or for example in my church, certain things are still done/recorded on paper: calendar events, church hall bookings, collection of money, etc. Due to everyone having access to the money of the church physically and there is no record of what money has been used for or who has given money, often the money tends to go missing or is misplaced especially since its physical money being worked with. Another example would be that bookings of the church hall often overlaps due to many people having access to booking the hall. Often bookings disappear or are thrown away by mistake because it was done on paper which would result in no bookings made, etc. Events for the year are often poorly planned, because no proper calendar is set up and since the calendars are printed not everyone would receive one, meaning that a few people in the church would actually know what the events for the month or for the week are. There are still various other issues, but these are the main areas.  

My solution is to have this problem turned into a computer-based system, so that all necessary admin can be done: church goers’ details can be saved in the database along with other relevant information such as pledges, collections, budgets, money usage(book keeping in other words), events taking place, hall bookings, etc. Through this system limited access should be implemented so that there won’t be money going missing or overlapping of church hall bookings. 

With this system one can then produce various reports to show the relevant church members of how much money was made during the family day on a specific date (including what expenses money was used to pay for). Reports on who are due to start paying pledges can be done, or who has upcoming birthdays, who has recently passed away or who are the frail and ill church goers at this point in time. Who are the confirmation students and who has been confirmed already, etc. Book keeping would also be done more precisely so that if something seems odd one can always go back and check what money was used for. Budgets can also be set up properly. This system would also save the relevant stakeholders time, as they would not need to constantly send emails to one another asking to see something, depending on their title they should be granted access to the relevant information which they are allowed to see. The main outcome/s for this system is to manage the church information and finances, get rid of using paper and limiting information on many of the church aspects to only relevant people.
